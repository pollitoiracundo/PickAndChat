# Product Requirements Document: Pick and Chat Chrome Extension

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for "Pick and Chat," a Chrome extension that allows users to select any DOM element from a webpage and send its content to a ChatGPT window for further interaction.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a seamless way for users to interact with web content using ChatGPT.
*   To create a simple and intuitive user experience for selecting and sending information.
*   To increase user productivity by reducing the steps required to copy and paste content into ChatGPT.

## 3. User Personas

*   **Researchers:** Quickly gathering information from various web sources and compiling it in ChatGPT.
*   **Students:** Easily sending text from online articles or textbooks to ChatGPT for summarization or explanation.
*   **Developers:** Sending code snippets or error messages to ChatGPT for debugging or analysis.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Extension Enablement

*   The extension will have a button in the Chrome toolbar.
*   Clicking the button will toggle the extension on and off.
*   When enabled, the extension will activate the DOM element selection feature.
*   When disabled, the extension will have no effect on the webpage.

### 4.2. DOM Element Selection

*   When the extension is enabled, moving the mouse over the webpage will highlight the DOM element currently under the cursor.
*   The highlighting will be a colored overlay, similar to the browser's developer tools inspector.

### 4.3. Sending Content to ChatGPT

*   When the user right-clicks on a highlighted DOM element, a new item will appear in the context menu with the label "Send to ChatGPT".
*   Clicking this menu item will trigger the following actions:
    1.  The extension will get the `innerHTML` of the selected DOM element.
    2.  All HTML tags will be stripped from the `innerHTML`, leaving only the plain text content.
    3.  A new browser window (or tab) will be opened using `window.open()` with the following URL: `https://chatgpt.com/?q=<encoded_text>`, where `<encoded_text>` is the URL-encoded plain text content.
    4.  If a window with the same name has been opened before, the new content will be sent to that same window, refreshing the content.

## 5. User Experience (UX) and Design

*   **Toolbar Icon:** The extension will have a clear and recognizable icon for the Chrome toolbar.
*   **Highlighting:** The overlay color for highlighting DOM elements should be distinct but not obstructive.
*   **Context Menu:** The "Send to ChatGPT" menu item should be clearly visible and easy to understand.

## 6. Technical Requirements

*   The extension will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   It will use standard Chrome extension APIs.
*   No external libraries are required for the initial version.
*   The extension will not store any user data.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   Number of active users.
*   Number of times content is sent to ChatGPT.
*   User ratings and reviews in the Chrome Web Store.

## 8. Future Work

*   Allowing users to customize the highlighting color.
*   Support for sending the full HTML of the element, not just the text.
*   Integration with other AI chat services.
*   Ability to append content to the ChatGPT window instead of replacing it.
